        <h1>Unrecruited in Canada to Division I</h1>
        <h2>Maryland midfielder Cayden Onagi moved 1,500 miles to achieve his Division I lacrosse dream</h2>

        <p>Onagi had a dream of playing Division I lacrosse despite playing in Manitoba, Canada where he wasn’t recruited. Onagi played for his high school, Sturgeon Heights, and a club team, the Manitoba Blizzard. In his first year on the varsity team in 2016, he was named Rookie of the Year. The team won its league championship in 2018 and he was named captain his senior year.</p>
        <p>“Where I’m from in Canada, lacrosse isn’t very big. We had one travel program and it got folded because there wasn’t enough kids,” Onagi said.</p>

    <div class="container2">
        <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Onagi decided to stay home and not go to college. Until he got a call from Harford Community College head coach Aaron Verardi. In the spring of 2021, Onagi made the move from Manitoba to Bel Air, Maryland.</p>
        <p>On April 10th, 2021, Onagi earned his first start against WVU Potomac State College. He scored in the first two minutes and didn’t stop there, ending the game with six goals and three assists. The nine-point performance helped Harford to an astonishing 32-1 win.
        </p>
        <p>“One of our attack men got injured and had to sit out. We were like ‘you know, let's give Cayden a shot,’” Verardi said, “As soon as we made that move, all of a sudden our offense, a lot more things started to click.”</p>

        <p>After the win, Onagi cemented himself into a starting role. He finished his freshman season as the team leader in goals (31), assists (15) and points (46). This earned him National Junior College Athletic Association All-American honors and the region’s Offensive Player of the Year.</p>
        <p>In his first full season in 2022, Onagi led the team again in goals (36), assists (22) and points (58). One of his best games came against Carroll Community College when he scored a career-high seven goals and added two assists.</p>
        <p>After back-to-back seasons winning All-American honors, Onagi was the number one ranked “JUCO player to watch” by Inside Lacrosse.</p>

        <p>Despite all the success, there were still struggles for Onagi. Being far away from home was a big adjustment and his grades started to slip.</p>
        <p>“There’s those times when something’s going on in the family and you’re far away from everything. That anxiety builds up a bit,” Verardi said, “He did struggle one semester academically, and the ability for him to refocus himself and gear toward that goal of getting to Maryland. After that, he had a great semester.”</p>
        <p></p>

    <div class="container2">
        <p>With his play on the field and academics improving, Onagi started to get offers from Division II schools. However, with his goal in mind of playing Division I lacrosse, he received another life-altering phone call from Maryland head coach John Tillman.</p>
        <p>“I was really surprised I got a call from coach Tillman,” Onagi said, “I was lucky enough to get a bunch of calls from a bunch of schools and coach Tillman was one of them. I was very thankful for that… it’s kind of like a dream come true.”</p>
        <p>Once Onagi worked to get his grades improved, the move became official. Despite already adjusting to multiple new places, the move from Harford to Maryland was one of the biggest.</p>
        <p>Although they are an hour apart, Harford has around 7,000 students compared to Maryland’s 40,000. This also means that more fans and scouts from professional lacrosse leagues will be attending the games.</p>

        <p>In his first appearance as a Terp, Onagi scored a fourth-quarter goal in their 15-4 win against Richmond. As a junior, he made just five appearances and scored two goals. However, Onagi’s playtime has decreased in 2024, making just two appearances.</p>
        <p>The Terps are now preparing for the NCAA tournament after finishing the regular season 8-4 with a 3-2 conference record. Maryland’s offense is struggling and injured meaning Tillman is looking for a spark, leading to Onagi appearing in the Big Ten tournament.</p>
        <p>Despite this, the Terps lost 19-9. However, their record still earned them the No. 7 seed in the NCAA tournament. They face Princeton on Saturday, a team Onagi played against earlier this season.</p>

    <div class="container2">
        <p>Away from lacrosse, Onagi has impacted his community in Canada and Maryland. While his journey was unconventional, he inspired other unrecruited players who want to continue playing lacrosse.</p>
        <p>“He’s kind of like a hometown hero,” Verardi said, “I didn’t realize how many people look up to him back home… It’s inspired some guys to come here and take this route. It’s really cool.”</p>
        <p>Harford’s 2024 roster featured four Canadian players with a similar path as Onagi.</p>
