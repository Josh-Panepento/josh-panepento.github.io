                <p>Hello! My name is Josh Panepento and I am a journalism student at the University of Maryland, College
                    Park. On this site you will find my published works, my social media and how to contact me.
                </p>
                <p>I am currently a junior and I plan on graduating in the spring of 2025. I am looking for internships
                    in the DMV area, specifically in the sports writing field.
                </p>
                <p>When I was at Howard Community College, I took an intro to journalism class and fell in love with it.
                    After joining the school's newpaper (the HCC Times) I knew I wanted to become a journalist. I would love to combine my knowledge and passion for sports with my journalism skills.
